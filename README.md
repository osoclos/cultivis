## Description

Cultivis is a fan-made project aimed to provide a simple yet intuitive visualizer for [Cult of the Lamb](https://cultofthelamb.com/). Currently, you can only view and export animations, but more exciting features will emerge as this project is being developed.

This project is inspired and is a continuation of [pocams](https://github.com/pocams)’ [cotlgif](https://github.com/pocams/cotlgif) project, which was discontinued in 2022.

## Usage

### Prelude

When you open up CultiVis for the first time, it may take a while to load in the assets or anything to start working. But once all the assets have loaded in, it will only take a few seconds to load the next time you come back to CultiVis.

There is also a disclaimer popup which informs you on what you can and cannot use or do with CultiVis. See the [CultiVis Terms of Service](ToS.md) for more information.

## Addition of New Content

I will add and update CultiVis with new content every time the game goes through a major update/when a noticeable change of content occurs. Keep in mind that this may take more than a few days to complete.

## Contact and Reporting

To contact or ask me about any enquires about CultiVis, you can DM me via Discord at [@osoclos](https://discord.com/users/1138108450073759784).

If you have a bug to report, you can either [create an issue](issues/new) on Github or send me information about the bug directly via Discord.

I will try my best to hide any assets that that don't appear in-game (yet) from being displayed in the visualizer.
