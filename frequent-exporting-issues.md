# Frequent Issues with Exporting Animations

## Q: My animation is all blocky and black in colour

A: This is usually an issue with your browser not loading the texture properly/completely. This can be fixed by clearing your cache (either by deleting site data and settings in your browser or hard-reloading the site with <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>Shift</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd>), or changing to a browser/device which is more powerful/performant and can handle more memory.

## Q: My animation does not loop properly

A: Ensure that the "Auto-trim Animation" is checked under the "Timing" section in the "Exporting" tab.

Note: If your animation contains more than one character which has different animations, it is recommended that you export them separately and use an external tool to combine them together.

## Q: My animation has blank spaces on the sides

A: Check the "Auto-Crop" option under the "Sizing" section in the "Exporting" tab.

## Q: My character is not centred properly 

A: You can click on the "Reset Position" button in the "Positioning" section after you have selected your desired character in the "Characters" tab to place it in the center.
