## Usage

Any user-generated content created from CultiVis is derived from the works of [Massive Monster Games](https://massivemonster.co/) and [Devolver Digital Inc.](https://devolverdigital.com/), and can be considered to be  legally owned by them, though you are allowed to share and distribute the content as long as there is reference or context that can be inferred to their work.

However, if any concerning parties deem your shared content to be inappropriate, derogatory or offensive in any way, the owner will not be held liable against any repercussions you face from posting or publishing said content.

## Updates, Disruptions and Accessibility

CultiVis is constantly being worked on to add, improve or replace functionality and accessibility to the website. This includes meeting the new requirements of web and other technological standards. This may result in service disruptions, modifications or removal of certain features, and unintended side effects from the features in question. This also includes the possibility for CultiVis to be susceptible to vulnerabilities and other potentially malicious threats and safety issues.

Therefore, the creator reserves the right to alter CultiVis to meet new requirements and update information, and to correct inaccuracies, errors and/or omissions anytime discretely.

## Feedback and Bugs

CultiVis is open to all feedback regarding the usage of the website and other improvements or additions to the Software. The creator or his subsidiaries oblige to make every effort to understand the specifics of the feedback and adapt it into the website.  

You have permission to contact the owner on any issues you encounter when using the website and report concerning bugs that affect your experience with CultiVis.

## Re-distribution and Adaption of Work

This clause does not pertain to the content that is created from using CultiVis, which is stated in the [Usage](#usage) section.

The creator allows redistribution of CultiVis and any adaptions of his work under the condition that all the terms in the ToS and OSL should be respected and provided in the replicated software. Otherwise, he has the right to demand termination of said software and take legal action against the owner of the copied software.

As CultiVis includes and utilizes the [Spine Runtimes](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes) software as a core component of the Software, if you intend to distribute the software, you are obliged to acknowledge the [Spine Runtimes License Agreement](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-runtimes-license) and [Section 2](https://esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license#s2) of the [Spine Editor License Agreement](https://en.esotericsoftware.com/spine-editor-license) unless the Spine Runtimes software is entirely removed from your software.

## Amendments to the ToS

To uphold consumer protection laws, the owner has complied to alert you of any amendments to the ToS or other agreements you will need to acknowledge the next time you access CultiVis. You can either choose to accept the new terms and be granted continued access to CultiVis, or otherwise refuse to agree to the ToS, in which case you will be denied access to the Software until you acknowledge the new terms.
